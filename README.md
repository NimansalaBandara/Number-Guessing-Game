The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console program where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the game provides feedback—whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct—until the player successfully guesses the number. The program uses the Random class for number generation and Scanner for user input. To run the game, compile and execute the NumberGuessingGame.java file.
